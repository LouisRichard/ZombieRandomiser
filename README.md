# ZombieRandomiser

Project made to randomise Black Ops 3 zombie games.
We played it so much with my friends, we decided to spice it up a little :)

# Installation
Will do just wait it's only been a few minutes damn

# General informations 
The project is written in C# .NET with the .NET Framework.
It's only meant to work on Windows. I'm sure there's way to run it on Linux and I'm sure you can figure it out by yourself :)

This software uses an SQLite database to store all the weapons, perks and maps as well as which weapons and perks are on which map.
