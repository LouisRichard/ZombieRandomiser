1. Button to randomise the map. Click this button to get a random map

3. Player color. This is the color the players score will appear as

5. Weapons. Include all weapons in the box and on the walls. A third option will appear if the player has Mule Kick in their perks.
6. Randomize button. Click here to randomise the perks and weapons according to the selected map.


## Rules <a name="rules"></a>

Here's how me and my friends play it :

* The final setup must be the same as the one in this window
* If it takes the player too long to get to their build, they may buy a wallgun temporarily
* The perks are to be bought In no perticular orther
* If the player just can't play with their randomised build and it kills the fun for him, he may reroll
* It none of the players have juggernog in their build, good luck :) 
* The players may use the Pack A Punch machine at will
* Gobblegums aren't restricted. You may pick whichever one you want
* Have fun :D  

You can, of course, make your own rules if you want



# Edit the program <a name="edit-the-program"></a>

## Add the database in the solution <a name="add-db"></a>

Before editing the program, there's a little thing you need to do

take the ZombieDB.db3 file and put it in the following folder : 

`ZombieRandomiser/ZombieRandomiser/bin/Debug`

if the folder doesn't exist, you can compile the program once and it should appear.

The debugger will spat out an error because, well, the database doesn't exist.



Once that's done, you can run the program and it should run just fine ðŸ¤ž



## NuGet packages <a name="nuget"></a>

This softwares uses the following NuGet Package :

* System.Data.SQLite

If it's not there, the program will not run
