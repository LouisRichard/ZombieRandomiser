## Rules <a name="rules"></a>

Here's how me and my friends play it :

* The final setup must be the same as the one in this window
* If it takes the player too long to get to their build, they may buy a wallgun temporarily
* The perks are to be bought In no perticular orther
* If the player just can't play with their randomised build and it kills the fun for him, he may reroll
* It none of the players have juggernog in their build, good luck :) 
* The players may use the Pack A Punch machine at will
* Gobblegums aren't restricted. You may pick whichever one you want
* Have fun :D  

You can, of course, make your own rules if you want

# General informations <a name="genral-informations"></a>
The project is written in C# .NET with the .NET Framework.
It's only meant to work on Windows. I'm sure there's way to run it on Linux and I'm sure you can figure it out by yourself :)

This software uses an SQLite database to store all the weapons, perks and maps as well as which weapons and perks are on which map.



# Edit the program <a name="edit-the-program"></a>

Before editing the program, there's a little thing you need to do

take the ZombieDB.db3 file and put it in the following folder : 

`ZombieRandomiser/ZombieRandomiser/bin/Debug`

if the folder doesn't exist, you can compile the program once and it should appear.

The debugger will spat out an error because, well, the database doesn't exist.



Once that's done, you can run the program and it should run just fine ðŸ¤ž
